# Skill Upgrade Learning Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a structured 45-day learning plan for team skill development during extra time outside of project work. The plan is designed for 1-2 hours of daily learning, organized into three phases: Foundation (15 days), Intermediate (30 days), and Advanced (45 days). Each skill includes realistic goals and measurable outcomes suitable for part-time learning.

## Progress Tracking


- [x] **Phase 1 Complete** (Days 1-15) - Foundation
- [ ] **Phase 2 Complete** (Days 16-30) - Intermediate  
- [ ] **Phase 3 Complete** (Days 31-45) - Advanced
